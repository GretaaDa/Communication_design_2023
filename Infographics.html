            One mistake people often do is that they avoid talking about what
            they are going through and mistreats the people close to them. What
            we need to do in the society is to normalise talking about our
            mental health and how to cope with people who need our help.

            Society has given the genders stereotypes about what they should
            talk about. Like the women are allowed to have feelings and should
            be able to express them meanwhile the men should not talk about how
            they’re feeling no matter what they’re going through.
